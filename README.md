# WannacryGui (Fake Ransomware UI)

⚠️ **Disclaimer**:  
This project is for educational and demonstration purposes **only**.  
It does not actually encrypt or decrypt files, and it is not intended for any malicious use.  

WannacryGui is a mock user interface that mimics the look of a ransomware-style popup (such as the infamous WannaCry) for fun or educational simulation. It does not perform any real harm to the system.
